# Project gdoc
This repository gathers Google application scripts that extend the Google suite.
The following applications are available:
1. Google doc
2. Google drive
3. Google sheet

# Google doc
Google doc provides features that are described in their own subsections below.
It relies on the advanced [Docs service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/docs) .
These features depend on options and settings that are attached either to
* the Google doc script itself,
* the document using that script, or
* a user of that script

These options are stored and retrived via the [Properties](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties) service.

## Numbered headings
## PDF management
## Spacing management
Consistent spacing makes a document look professional. It is always associated with automatic formatting, i.e. formatting that is not based on adding blank lines or spaces to achieve the desired visual effect.

This application allows for headings to stick to the content that follows the heading, avoiding orphaned headings at the bottom of a page. This is a n option that is turned on by default but that can be turned off on a per document basis.

It also removes all blank lines from the document. This is an option that is turned on by default but that can be switched off on a per document basis.
