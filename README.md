# Project gdoc
This repository gathers Google application scripts that extend the Google suite.
The following applications are available:
1. Google doc
2. Google drive
3. Google sheet

# Google doc
Google doc provides features that are described in their own subsections below.
It relies on the advanced [Docs service](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/docs). Refer to the [guide](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/docs) for document structure and to the [reference](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/document) for the built-in library. For complex operations that aren't accessible via the library, you need to use the [API reference](https://developers.google.com/docs/api/reference/rest) and rely on `get` and `batchUpdate` to change the document state.

These features depend on options and settings that are attached either to
* the Google doc script itself,
* the document using that script, or
* a user of that script

These options are stored and retrived via the [Properties](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties) service.
 
## List manipulation
Lists are paragraphs that are numbered or bulleted. Typically, a list is a set of contiguous paragraphs, but sometimes you want to interleave other content with the list.
## Numbered headings
## PDF management
## Spacing management
Consistent spacing makes a document look professional. It is always associated with automatic formatting, i.e. formatting that is not based on adding blank lines or spaces to achieve the desired visual effect.

This application allows for headings to stick to the content that follows the heading, avoiding orphaned headings at the bottom of a page. This is a n option that is turned on by default but that can be turned off on a per document basis.

It also removes all blank lines from the document. This is an option that is turned on by default but that can be switched off on a per document basis.

It provides vairous ways to insert extra space between paragraphs and automate spacing around tables.
